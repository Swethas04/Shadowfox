        <h2>About Rohit</h2>
        <p>
            Rohit Sharma is one of the most accomplished players in IPL history. Fondly called the “Hitman,” he is known
            for his effortless sixes and calm demeanor. Rohit took over as Mumbai Indians captain in 2013 and led the
            team to five IPL titles—making MI one of the most successful franchises. His ability to read the game,
            support young talents, and deliver under pressure makes him a legend not only in the MI camp but also in
            world cricket. Even when not captaining, Rohit’s presence adds immense value to the team’s morale and
            performance.
