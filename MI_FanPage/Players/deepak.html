        <h2>About Deepak</h2>
        <p>
            Deepak Chahar is known for his ability to swing the ball both ways with the new ball. Typically used in the
            powerplay, Deepak has often struck early to dismantle top orders. With his calm mindset and experience, he
            brings control and strength to MIâ€™s bowling arsenal. He can also contribute with handy runs down the order.
